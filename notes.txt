initial spread of 20 at [0, 0, 0] is a pretty uniform initialization
the coordinates are a little wonky in some views, but they are consistant.
the XY plane is perpendicular to the screen, and positive Z is up.
mathematically, the coordinates of the system are translated down (up?) by 27.
when you spawn particles at [0, 0, 0], they actually spawn at [0, 0, 27].

next steps for this project:
    allow realtime adjustment of the function parameters
    figure out how to make an envelope follower for an audio stream so that timestep can synchronize with music
