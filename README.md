 Made with p5.js

 This project is my first attempt at exploring the 3D capabilities of the p5 library. Besides looking cool, this project can also illustrate how a very tightly-grouped region of particles in this system will quickly diverge over time. Try setting spread to 0, it actually goes to 1 billionth of a unit.

In the future, I plan on adding real-time controls for the parameters sigma, rho, and beta, that determine the motion of the particles (https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)
